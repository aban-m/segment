## Visual Style

- **Theme**: Corporate and clean
- **Primary color**: Blue (cool tones — navy, sky, slate)
- **Font**: Inter or IBM Plex Sans
- **Accent colors**: Subtle grayscale tones, soft highlight colors
- **Images**: Rounded profile pictures, default avatar fallback

## Page Layout Principles

- Keep layouts focused and distraction-free
- Prioritize information hierarchy (profile, connection buttons, stats)
- Use cards or panels to separate content sections
- Ensure forms (onboarding/profile editing) are clean and minimal
- Maintain whitespace for a breathable feel

## Accessibility and Mobile-First Notes

- Ensure all actions are keyboard-navigable
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles where needed
- Mobile-first design: layouts should gracefully adapt down
- Button and text sizes should be legible on small screens
- Use color contrast guidelines for accessibility

## Brand Tone & Voice

- Professional but approachable
- Clear and minimal language (avoid jargon)
- No notifications or gamification features — keep it intentional
- Prioritize trust and control over user data sharing
